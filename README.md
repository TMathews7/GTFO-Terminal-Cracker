# GTFO-Terminal-Cracker
GTFO - Terminal Cracker is a tool that types password guesses into terminals. 
Yes this is a tool for cheating. Yes it is cringe to wait 40 minutes to crack a terminal.

## ⚠️ Important Notice ⚠️ ## - Because I am bad at python.

- This tool **takes control of your keyboard input**.
- It simulates real keypresses using `pyautogui`, meaning **it will actively type and press keys on your system**.
- **Do not use your computer during execution.**

## Features

- GUI interface with prefix/suffix filtering for situations such as "__OP" being the information you have
- Adjustable skip-to-letter feature, in case you need to stop the program.
- Displays expected maximum/average time
- Console output to see where the program currently is.

## Usage

1. Ensure you are ready at the terminal. Not in a alarm.
2. Launch the script or executable.
3. Choose your filter (prefix/suffix).
4. Optionally set a skip-to letter to jump ahead in the list.
5. Click **Start**. The app waits 10 seconds before typing begins.
6. Once you hit start before 10 seconds has passed click your instance of gtfo.
7. Wait until it finds the correct password.
8. Close program once its found password, it will not detect if you have or not.
